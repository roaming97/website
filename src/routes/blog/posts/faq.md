This article is a homage to the first version of this website (early 2019)
which had a frequently asked questions section even if there weren't many.

<br />

# Who are you?

I am **roaming97**, a terribly curious guy with interest in terribly specific things. Throughout my whole life I've had a lot of different hobbies, most of these involving a computer. I began creating videos in **2012** but only started to do so under this pseudonym on late **2016**.

My creations from back then could be described as aimless experimental video art, all made for fun. In **2018**, I decided to take my fascination with graphic and visual design seriously. Fortunately this decision landed me a couple of jobs in the following years! My first one was at a music label in **2019** helping with promotional material and music videos. This gig helped me build a network of musical artists for freelance collaborations. All of these commissions ultimately motivated me to pursue a B.Des. In Multimedia Design and Digital Art _(rough translation)_ in **2020** which I graduated from in **2024**.

<br />

During that time I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create my website several years ago, initially aimed to host my videos outside of YouTube but later also served as my professional portfolio. I also explored several other languages and tools for personal projects, which were invaluable learning experiences and currently help me make a living. :)

<br />

I'm still at a pretty volatile state when it comes to balancing my hobbies and professional work, so I can't promise this question will remain answered like this forever.

<br />

# Were you born in 1997?

No.

<br />

# How did you come up with your nickname then?

Some figured this one out already, but for those of you who didn't:

<br />

`roaming -->` _C:\Users\You\AppData\Roaming_ folder on Windows.

`97 -->` _Windows 9x_ because of vaporwave (explained in the next question).

<br />

Despite my nickname being utterly unoriginal, I have refused to change it after all these years
because that would imply doing a complete rebuild of my "brand", which I can't be bothered to do at this point.

<br />

# What about your logo?

Back in 2017 I used to listen to vaporwave.

As some of you may know it involved 'Windows 9X' and the rise of personal computing as one of its stylistic elements. With that in mind, I used the old Windows flag as my legacy logo throughout 2017 and 2018 (not a logo I necessarily have the rights to), then proceeded to redesign that logo with some aspects from the Windows flag (which was still not very original). Finally, I designed the current logo from scratch to finally leave a dependency of another logo behind for good, no more copyright infringement!
