This article is a homage to the first version of this website (early 2019)
which had a frequently asked questions section even if there weren't many.

<br />
<br />

# Were you born in 1997?

No.

<br />

# How did you come up with your nickname then?

Some figured this one out already, but for those of you who didn't:

<br />

`roaming -->` _C:\Users\You\AppData\Roaming_ folder on Windows.

`97 -->` _Windows 9x_ because of vaporwave (explained in the next question).

<br />

Despite my nickname being utterly unoriginal, I have refused to change it after all these years
because that would imply doing a complete rebuild of my "brand", which I can't be bothered to do at this point.

<br />

# What about your logo?

Back in 2017 I used to listen to vaporwave.

As some of you may know it involved 'Windows 9X' and the rise of personal computing as one of its stylistic elements. With that in mind, I used the old Windows flag as my legacy logo throughout 2017 and 2018 (not a logo I necessarily have the rights to), then proceeded to redesign that logo with some aspects from the Windows flag (which was still not very original). Finally, I designed the current logo from scratch to finally leave a dependency of another logo behind for good, no more copyright infringement!
