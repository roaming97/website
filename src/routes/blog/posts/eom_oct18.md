Hm, I have done plenty of things this month:

<br>

For example: I began to work on other projects as well as learning a new piece of software to add to my video editing knowledge, that being **[Premiere Pro](https://creativecloud.adobe.com/cc/learn/premiere-pro/web/what-is-premiere-pro-cc?locale=en)**.

<br>

Due to some interactions I've had both online and in real life, I was inspired to take the roaming97 project to a new direction next year, having said that there's still some planning to do.

<br>

## Additional context

Back in 2018 I used to identify my videos by numbers so I and whoever watched my content could know which one I was talking about as they sometimes had recherch√© titles making them hard to distinguish.

<br>

**_Now, about video 4..._**

After working on it for about a month I could not help but notice how spotty and stylistically inconsistent it looked. So I will be redoing the video from the ground up to give it a cleaner look and execution. It mainly shows 3D models and wireframes, like this one:

footnote: by the way, this is not resampling, it's a mild trail i applied to the frame.

<br>

So because of that it's unlikely that video 4 will be the next video that I will release but something else instead. I still hope to bring myself to complete this video before the end of the year, which I still doubt because of all the activities and responsibilities that take up my time, which are mainly the reason I have been leaving this site inactive in periods of 2-3 weeks.

<br>

It has been a fun month, I will still try to finish everything or at least make significant progress on all of my projects before the end of the year. Hoping for a just as fun October.
