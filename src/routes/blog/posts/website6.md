# Preface

Creating a personal website isn't a difficult task today. You can easily make a [carrd.co](https://carrd.co/) page, a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) blog, a basic [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) or [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) static site using a template or even use a no-code platform like [Webflow](https://webflow.com/), they're pretty easy to use, fairly customizable, and these let you get your brand sailing on the internet outside of social media platforms without having to worry about handling an entire technology stack from scratch quickly.

<br>

And here I am, doing it in the most unnecessarily complicated way possible.

<br>

This is the culmination of **two years** of work since the release of version 5, hopefully it will be the last version for my website I will have to write ever, it will also be the version where I will try to host as much of my content as I can gradually.

<br>

# What did I change in this version?

For one I aimed to balance between showcasing my professional work but also showing some of my personal hobbies and passions, recent versions had too much of the former and older too much of the latter, which makes sense considering the amount of portfolio work to show I had at the time. Leaving all my personal stuff in the **Nook** section.

## Technical mumbo jumbo
