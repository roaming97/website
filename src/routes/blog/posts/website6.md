# Preface

Creating a personal website isn't a difficult task nowadays. You can easily make a [carrd.co](https://carrd.co/) page, a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) blog, a basic [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) or [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) site using a template or even use a no-code platform like [Webflow](https://webflow.com/), they're pretty easy to use, fairly customizable, and these let you get your brand sailing on the internet outside of social media platforms without having to worry about building the entire stack from scratch in a quick way.

<br>

And here I am, doing it in the most unnecessarily complicated way possible.

<br>

This is the culmination of **two years** of work since the release of version 5, hopefully it will be the last version for my website I will have to write ever, it will also be the version where I will try to host as much of my content as possible.

<br>

# What did I change in this version?

<br>

<style>
    a {
        text-decoration: underline;
    }
    h1 > a {
        text-decoration: none;
    }
</style>
