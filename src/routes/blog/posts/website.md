Hello there! It's pretty nice to finally release my own website, a space where I can do pretty much whatever I want, instead of trying to fit in the YouTube system which keeps getting worse by the day.

<br>

In the face of the internet's independent video streaming platforms, like the recently closed vid.me, I wanted to make this space for myself and completely myself. Obviously other people may enter this website to watch/read/download my content, but I want to keep this as my main gateway to publish my material.

<br>

This website was made from scratch with Notepad++, I definitely wasn't that comfortable on making it in an existing website builder like Wix or Squarespace, they would just not meet my needs. This site was made as being all-in-one thing where I post updates, upload my videos, etc. without the need to make more social media, just keeping it all in the same place.

<br>

~~Anyway, I'll keep updating within the next couple of days...~~
