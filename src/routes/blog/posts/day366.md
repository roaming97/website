# Preface

This is roaming97 from the future; this was supposed to be finished 2.5 years ago. After an extensive rewrite of this article, it's finally complete.

<br />

Hello! It's been a while since I've left these humongous walls of text which describe in detail certain situation I am currently in for you to read, except this time is not something that's happening but something that already happened.

I figured it'd be a good idea to finally talk about all of what has been going on behind the scenes, or rather, inside my mind on how in the world I even got the motivation to start this, and not only that, but keep going and achieve this objectively negligible but subjectively significant milestone. I thought it would be a good read for anybody that is interested in knowing the process and experiences throughout that period of time.

<br />

So buckle up, because this is going to be an extremely long read!

<br />

# Compelled

Surely, the first question that will come to mind is along the words of: _"What motivated you to begin this artistic journey? / How did you get the idea to start this?"_ and I would just throw an _"I don't know"_ like I usually do, but retrospectively, I think I know the answer for this.

<br />

2020 (excluding _that_ event) was a pretty mundane year for me when it came to creating content for roaming97: two videos per year and not many posts outside of the usual retweet about any work I was involved in, 04 Collective releases for example. I had finally managed to form a clearer personal brand, and it was the year I could safely say I had left aside my more jokey side around my nickname which was something I was thinking of doing for 3 years at that point.

<br />

2021 arrived and I was determined to create more content than ever before, with 04 Collective's closure I was pretty much "unemployed", so that meant it was time to show my portfolio to potential clients. My portfolio needed some remodelling as well as an addition of new content, despite all the material that thankfully the label incidentally provided me with during its run. With that in mind, I entered an event that consisted of designing artwork or producing music in a span of 24 hours hosted by [FORM](https://artbyform.com), [All Nighter Volume 6](https://anv6.artbyform.com/). I, of course, didn't win the grand prize of being the face of the album by getting my artwork chosen for the cover, but I was nonetheless satisfied with the result.

<br />

Shortly after this I received a pretty long video commission which was a [30 minute video that I completed in a weekend](https://x.com/roaming98/status/1374798661058695177), it was a music live set composed entirely of VJ loops, wasn't as simple as I make it sound here.

<br />

Even with all of these intense crunches of designing, modelling, rendering, editing, and compositing back to back in the span of just a few days... I was left with a craving for taking on a similar challenge again, without waiting an entire year for the next iteration of the event to happen or the next blue moon for another client to ask for a commission, so just for the sake of it I fired up my creative software and made a piece in less than a day, **_[JUICE](https://x.com/roaming98/status/1374821900715712518/photo/1)_**. I thought the final result was good... but not good enough, so I posted another piece the next day, titled it **_[JUST FINISH SOMETHING](https://x.com/roaming98/status/1375215295619604480/photo/1)_** as I was already struggling with this sudden change of pace, remaining unsatisfied I've made another one the next day. And another one, and anoth- you know where this is going!

# Every single day

I should probably mention this right off the bat: my everydays are transparently inspired by Beeple's, even following a similar structure.

My everydays were divided into 4 seasons (as opposed to rounds like Beeple's) composed of 96 days each, I didn't know it would be serialized this way from day one, it was a last minute decision by day 97, the suffix to my nickname which was appropriately the title for that piece:

<br />

[roaming97 embed goes here (1374821900715712518)]

<br />

The layout for these was very simple although disorganized at first: have my nickname somewhere, the title of the artwork, the day number, its publication date, and the software I used to create that piece in particular in a comma-separated line of text.

<br />

_"Am I gonna take a break on weekends?"_, _"What if I miss a day?"_, and _"What will I do if I have an emergency and I can't be in front of my computer to post that day's artwork?"_ are questions that emerged often with every passing day of this now routinely exercise. To ensure that I wasn't going to lose interest in this by the third week, I gathered a huge amount of willpower from God knows where to just get through it. As long as I'd finish something every day, **including weekends**, I could rest at ease.

<br />

Despite these questions, I think the most intrusive one that would pop up was, _What am I even gonna do today? I'm completely dry of ideas!_

<br />

It's no secret that one of the things keeping me from posting more constantly in _any_ of my social media (Twitter, YouTube, and Vimeo at the time) during the first years of this project was the world-infamous creative block when I considered four posts a year overflowing amount of content. This series then served really well at training my mind on getting ideas out of thin air and learning to stop being so prideful about not taking references or using existing visual material as inspiration. Simultaneously, I was enriching my toolkit with more plugins, addons, scripts, utilities, and even entire programs to streamline the technical process so I could focus on the creative one for as long as possible.

<br />

Adding the self-deprecating artist trope into the mix, until then I'd never got to appreciate or even respect my own effort put into my work, either by a frail self-esteem or a disproportionate sense of perfectionism that in hindsight wasn't really present with the exception of a handful of pieces made throughout the year-long marathon. Most of these felt like another chore to complete next to school assignments and commission work, but whenever inspiration truly struck, it was definitely something special.

<br />

I can confidently pinpoint the first instance of this to one morning in April 2021, originating day 33's theme from a dream.

<br />

Dreams and their creative potential are concepts that I'd like to explore in a future project and give my own take on it, ignoring how overused the theme has been for decades at this point, I just think it'd be interesting.

<br />

<!--
Around late April 2021, I had this one dream about a landscape where I'd really like to be at if it existed. This definitely wasn't the first time it happens, I've been having these lucid dreams about landscapes ever since I can remember, but the everydays were a perfect catalyst to finally bring one of those ideas to life, as I had to do it quickly while still keeping some quality to it. Thus, [day 33](/view/33) happened, and something happened that up until then hadn't ever happened before in the almost 5 years (at the time) I had been doing art and video stuff: I actually liked something I'd made. This of course doesn't sound like too much when written like that, but it definitely meant a lot to myself, the fact that I could finally create something that I was happy with, it was truly special.
-->

<br />

After the first season, I got the hang of it. I knew what to usually do, the thought process, the software, techniques, etc. Well, those were the only factors that I thought were involved during the creation of these pieces.

<br />

I also thought this series was going to last longer than a year.

<br />

# Obstacle(s)

The variables that were involved _of course_ turned out to be many more and much more significant than I expected, it wasn't only the ideas and render times, but it was also what circumstances surrounded me, for example if I was going to be out of town (which did happen while the everydays were happening, I had to create two pieces on a single day so I could upload the second one the next day through my phone), or I was sick and whatnot, I didn't consider those possibilities, or rather, didn't put too much thought to them when I started the series.

<br />

One of the main concerns evidently was time, there would be occasions when I would not be able to use a computer, let alone the creative software I usually utilize for these pieces of artwork. And what caused that time variable to shrink? Mainly school. I don't want to sound like I'm blaming school like an angry teen "oh! skool sukz!", this is a series I am extremely passionate about, but I'd like to think I have well established priorities; school being a couple of steps above the everydays, along with my commissioned work.

In addition to time it was ideas one of the variables at play. I know I mentioned this wasn't as major of a reason, since the main point of doing these everydays was to learn how to handle creative blocks for some of my bigger projects (which ironically I have not been able to finish because of the everydays, conscious choice), but at some point this and the previous part of the equation would leave me with no time or ideas at all for a piece that day, which would result in extremely basic artwork that I was of course not happy with but wasn't worth sacrificing the entire everyday streak up until that point.

<br />

In a fewer words, I was letting these variables take control over the everydays most of the time, because they were usually for more important stuff like school, work, it wasn't really worth sacrificing those things just because I wanted to add extra detail to a single piece of artwork.

<br />

Mainly, the reason I gave this section the name it has is because I could've discarded these variables if I didn't have other responsibilities in my life, really everything could boil down to one simple thing, and I'm think I'm not alone when talking about it: **perfectionism**.

At this point the only reason why I hadn't released anything video related that's mildly elaborated in the last couple years is beacause... I didn't finish them or plain dropped those projects because I didn't like how they looked, resulting in them being either canned or in standby indefinitely. Keep in mind, these videos were in the making way before I started the everydays, I have one project that I was looking to release on December 31st, 2019, another one that I was looking to release on December 31st, 2020, another one on December 31st, 2021, you get the pattern.

I am not going to go in too much detail on what each project was in case I someday decide to finish any of them, I would not consider this an obstacle but a problem, a problem I feel I can solve now, but I want to share a couple more thoughts before getting there, hang on.

<br />

# Painware

For this section I am going to ask for your patience, I will take my sweet time to rant a lot here but hopefully it ties up together nicely at the end.

<br />

I used _[Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)_ for image editing and general compositing of the final artwork. This was the case until around season two when I just got sick of all of its performance problems, which is definitely something that I've seen a lot of folks complain about already. It was a giant pile of problems that kept slowly piling up, not since I've started making the everydays, I'm talking since I've started using Photoshop or Adobe software at all back in 2012-2013.

9-10 years of pure stress and frustration finally blowing up during the everydays.

This is exactly what happened with me and _[Adobe Flash](https://www.adobe.com/products/animate.html)_, I stuck with Macromedia Flash 8 for the longest time before switching to Flash CS6 in 2015 then switching back to it in 2017, figured this would be a good time to share this fact.

<br />

I wouldn't ever finish this text if I was to list every single complaint that I have with the software by this company, I'd like to also state that it's not an attempt to diss Adobe, regardless of the company I would still mention that I've had problems with it, for example _[Cavalry](https://cavalry.scenegroup.co/)_, an obscure motion graphics alternative to After Effects that wasn't really an alternative back when I tried its beta builds and 1.0, at least that's what I can recall.

<br />

I am still waiting for my beta tester license.

<br />

Adobe Photoshop might come with the latest and greatest technology breakthroughs of the last years applied to image editing, but these features didn't mean anything to me if I couldn't use them without Photoshop crashing every ten minutes. Might've been my computer at the time, or rather, at multiple intervals of time every new update came out. I mean, after a couple of versions, I should've gotten used to having my specs be completely obsolete by the next major version of the program, **_but by every single tiny bugfix update?_** Not only that, there would be times when they would change keyboard shortcuts for no reason, and one time they even changed completely how some color spaces worked for no reason, every new image I would create would have a cooler color temperature by default.

<br />

Day 140, _"[software problems](/viewer/day140)"_. That one day Photoshop had corrupted the artwork I had been trying to create that day three times. I was done with Adobe software, after so many years worth of problems I decided it was time to finally migrate to other software.

And thus, my migration to alternatives begun.

<br />

This alternative didn't have to be free and open source, although I had been trying _[that one program](https://www.gimp.org/)_ first as a viable replacement for Photoshop, suffice to say it was nowhere near close to that. You know what they say: "Mistakes are life's greatest lessons", so it was thanks to the mistake of trying that one program that I decided to not put too much faith into free software. Don't get me wrong! I love Blender, it is definitely one of the greatest feats of the open-source community software-wise; at least that's what I'd like to think, I'm not exactly an open-source software connoisseur.

<br />

In the end, I stuck with this Photoshop alternative I kept seeing people talk about, Affinity Photo.

Cheaper, as functional as Photoshop, and overall more stable when running. Just about what I look for in creative software.

It may not have the latest and greatest cutting edge technology features, but I am willing to accept the tradeoff if it means I will not have to deal with crashes every few minutes again.

<br />

As for my main 3D software, it has always been Blender. I experimented a bit using Maya only because of its _"industry standard"_ factor, and because I was being "taught" that software at the time in school, but unfortunately I couldn't warm up to it after trying it several times. In fact, I think Blender was my main software of choice period. My scenes consisted of mostly 3D objects or props in a scene, and since I couldn't draw at the time, it's what I used.
