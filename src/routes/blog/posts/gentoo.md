# Comfort

Year: 2021. I was making some improvements to my creative workflow by switching tools and programs, along the way a strong interest on the Linux ecosystem flourished. This interest came with utmost uncertainty as with most people who aren't familiar with it. The term "tech-savvy" didn't fit my description as an unsuspecting computer user back then, before knowing I'd be working as a developer full-time a couple of years later with the benefit of hindsight.

Despite all the angst that Windows provoked me, it was just too comfortable to outright leave. I was also still in college and working as a freelance designer simultaneously so I wasn't going to jump ship anytime soon due to my heavy reliance on proprietary software and some Windows-exclusive programs.

Eventually, I gave in and thanks to the magic of virtualization and a copy of Oracle's VirtualBox filled with old Windows machines, I dared to give Linux a try.
