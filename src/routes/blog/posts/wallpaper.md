I've made a wallpaper during the scarce free time I have in order to not get rusty, feel free to use it for your desktop, you may print it and then eat it, I don't know, do whatever you'd like. Maybe one day I'll upload more of these and even be just one frame of a whole video, who knows?

Only available in 16:9. Again, I'll maybe release more later on, but for now there's that.
