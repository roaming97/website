It is 2023, so a new update to my website was bound to come out. This update mostly upgrades dependencies, for example [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)'s 1.0 release; as well as making it more performant and better looking, the usual UI/UX stuff.

<br />

I am looking to get a **CDN** soon to, well, deliver static files without the need to clutter the repository for this website.
