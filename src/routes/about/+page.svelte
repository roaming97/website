			Now, who is this person who didn't want to introduce himself on the home page of his own
			website?
		</p>
		<p>
			Hi! I am <b class="text-brand-a font-bold">roaming97</b>, a terribly curious guy with
			interest in terribly specific things. Throughout my whole life I've had a lot of
			different hobbies, most of those involving a computer with the two purposes of learning
			new stuff in the current digital world we live in and serve as a distraction from
			school. I began creating videos in 2012 but only started to do so under this pseudonym
			in late 2016. The creations from back then were made with no real purpose or direction
			yet so it was more like experimental video art, all made for fun.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2018 I wanted to take graphic and visual design more seriously. Turns out this move
			landed me a couple of jobs in the following years! My first one was at 04 Collective in
			2019 helping with the visual material for releases as well as promotional material, it
			was a pretty fun experience which I talk about in more detail <a href="/blog/04_closing"
				>here</a
			>. Nevertheless, thanks to that "small" gig I was able to make a pretty modest musical
			artist network that I worked with as well via my freelance work. All of these
			commissions ultimately motivated me to study a B.Des. in Multimedia Design and Digital
			Art in 2020, and after 4 years I managed to successfully graduate.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another skill I worked on improving during this period was programming, I learned HTML,
			CSS, and JavaScript to make the first version of this website back in 2018 so I had a
			place to host my videos outside of YouTube, which then became useful to also host my
			professional portfolio once 2019 came around. After this I learned Python and Rust which
			came in handy for some personal projects. This is what I currently work as, usually
			frontend but I also know my way around backend web development.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am currently working on improving my web developer portfolio as well as other creative
			projects that have been in the works for the past years, but we'll see when will be the
			right time to unveil them. Until then this is where it stands.
